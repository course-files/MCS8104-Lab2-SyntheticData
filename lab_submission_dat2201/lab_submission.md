# Lab Submission

**Note:** There is a difference between data and information. The procedure, function, and view must all make an effort to process the data into information; apply statistical formulas where possible.

The procedure and function must include an IF statement or any other similar control flow function.

## The Procedure

```sql
-- Add your code here
```

## The Function

```sql
-- Add your code here
```

## The View that makes use of the Function

```sql
-- Add your code here
```

## A User to Access only the View

```sql
-- Add your code here
```
